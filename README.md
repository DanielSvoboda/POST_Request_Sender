# POST_Request_Sender

This code is an HTML form that allows the user to submit a POST request to a specified URL with up to 10 key/value pairs as parameters. When the form is submitted, a POST request is sent to the specified URL using JavaScript and the response is displayed on the page with the URL, request status, request parameters, and current date/time. If the response is JSON, it will be formatted and displayed as text. Otherwise, it will be displayed as plain text.
